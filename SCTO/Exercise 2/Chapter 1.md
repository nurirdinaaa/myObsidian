# Chapter 1: Introduction to Blockchain

## What Is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized, tamper-resistant ledger that records transactions across a network of untrusted peers. It aims to provide security and robustness in contexts where mutual trust is lacking. Here are some key points about blockchain:

- **Definition**: A blockchain is a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions.
- **Tamper-Resistant**: Once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted.
- **Decentralization**: No central authority controls the blockchain; it relies on consensus mechanisms.

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing programs deployed on a blockchain. They maintain persistent state and support transactions that transform the state. Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

- **Definition**: Smart contracts are programmable code that runs on a blockchain.
- **State Management**: Smart contracts can maintain state (e.g., bank accounts, virtual currency).
- **Immutable Transactions**: Transactions are permanently recorded on the ledger.

## Obsidian Markdown

Obsidian Markdown is a lightweight markup language that integrates seamlessly with Obsidian. It allows you to create structured notes, link between them, and organize your knowledge. Here‚Äôs how you can use it:

1. **Headers**: Use `#` for headings (e.g., `# Chapter 1: Introduction to Blockchain`).
2. **Lists**: Create bullet or numbered lists for organizing content.
3. **Links**: Use double square brackets to link related notes (e.g., `[[Smart Contracts]]`).
4. **Code Blocks**: Enclose code snippets in triple backticks (e.g., `python\nprint("Hello, Blockchain!")`).

Remember that Obsidian‚Äôs strength lies in its ability to create a web of interconnected notes. Feel free to explore more features as you write your chapter! üåü
