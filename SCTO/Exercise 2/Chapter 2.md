# Chapter 2: Example of Blockchain

## Scenario: Digital Asset Tracking

Suppose we want to create a blockchain-based system for tracking digital assets (e.g., digital certificates, intellectual property, or cryptocurrency). Here‚Äôs how we can represent this scenario using Obsidian Markdown:

### 1. Define the Asset

Let‚Äôs consider a digital certificate issued by a university. Each certificate contains information about the recipient, the degree earned, and the date of issuance.

### 2. Create a Blockchain

We‚Äôll create a blockchain to store and verify these certificates. Each certificate will be a block in the chain.

### 3. Block Structure

A block in our blockchain will have the following components:

- **Data**: The digital certificate information.
- **Timestamp**: When the certificate was added to the blockchain.
- **Previous Hash**: A reference to the hash of the previous block.
- **Nonce**: A value used in proof-of-work (if applicable).

### 4. Hashing and Linking

Each block‚Äôs data will be hashed, and the hash will be used as the ‚Äúprevious hash‚Äù for the next block. This ensures the integrity and immutability of the chain.

### 5. Verification

To verify a certificate, we follow the chain from the most recent block to the genesis block. If all hashes match, the certificate is valid.

### Example Certificate Block (Obsidian Markdown):

```markdown
# Certificate Block 1

- **Recipient**: John Doe
- **Degree**: Bachelor of Science
- **Issued Date**: January 15, 2024
- **Timestamp**: 2024-01-15 10:00 AM
- **Previous Hash**: 0000abcd1234 (hash of the previous block)
- **Nonce**: 12345 (proof-of-work value)

---

# Certificate Block 2

- **Recipient**: Jane Smith
- **Degree**: Master of Arts
- **Issued Date**: February 5, 2024
- **Timestamp**: 2024-02-05 11:30 AM
- **Previous Hash**: 0000efgh5678 (hash of the previous block)
- **Nonce**: 67890 (proof-of-work value)
```

Remember that this is a simplified example. Real-world blockchain systems involve more complexity, consensus mechanisms, and security considerations. But this should give you a basic understanding of how blockchain can be applied.
