# Chapter 3: Implementation of Blockchain

## Designing a Simple Blockchain

### 1. Data Structure

A blockchain consists of a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions. In Obsidian Markdown, we can represent this as follows:

```markdown
# Block 1

- **Data**: Transaction details (e.g., sender, receiver, amount)
- **Timestamp**: When the block was added
- **Previous Hash**: Hash of the previous block
- **Nonce**: Proof-of-work value (if applicable)

---

# Block 2

- **Data**: More transactions
- **Timestamp**: Timestamp for this block
- **Previous Hash**: Hash of Block 1
- **Nonce**: Another proof-of-work value
```

### 2. Hashing and Linking

Each block‚Äôs data is hashed, and the resulting hash becomes the ‚Äúprevious hash‚Äù for the next block. This ensures the integrity of the chain.

### 3. Verification

To verify the blockchain, follow the chain from the most recent block to the genesis block. If all hashes match, the blockchain is valid.

## Example (Obsidian Markdown):

```markdown
# Block 1

- **Data**: Alice sends 10 coins to Bob
- **Timestamp**: 2024-02-01 10:00 AM
- **Previous Hash**: 0000abcd1234
- **Nonce**: 12345

---

# Block 2

- **Data**: Bob sends 5 coins to Carol
- **Timestamp**: 2024-02-02 11:30 AM
- **Previous Hash**: 0000efgh5678
- **Nonce**: 67890
```

### Obsidian Markdown Tips:

1. Use `#` for headings.
2. Create bullet or numbered lists for organized content.
3. Use double square brackets to link related notes.
4. Enclose code snippets in triple backticks for code blocks.

Remember, this is a high-level overview. Real-world blockchain implementations involve more complexity, consensus algorithms, and security considerations. Explore Obsidian‚Äôs capabilities further as you document your blockchain journey! üåü
